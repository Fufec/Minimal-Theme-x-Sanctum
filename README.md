# Minimal-Theme-x-Sanctum
An obsidian theme preset I personally use, heavily inspired by the Sanctum's color scheme

## Installation
You need to download the Minimal Theme and a Style settings plugin. After that, just press the Import button and select my style-settings.json. That's it!

Tip: If you'd like the color to be applied in both the panel and the main window, download Minimal Theme Settings plugin and in the option `Dark mode background contrast` select `Low contrast`.
