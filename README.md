# Minimal-Theme-x-Sanctum
An obsidian theme preset I personally use, heavily inspired by the Sanctum's color scheme

## Installation
You need to download the Minimal Theme and a Style settings plugin. After that, activate the plugin and press the Import button and select the downloaded `style-settings.json`. That's it!

**Tip**: If you'd like the color to be applied in both the panel and the main window, download Minimal Theme Settings plugin and in the option `Dark mode background contrast` select `Low contrast`.
